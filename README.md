# path_helper

Hard-coding strings is bad, yet you probably hard-code your `PATH`. This way is far more organised. You could even target it with your app!

## <a name="what-is-it-">WHAT IS IT?</a>

A replacement for Apple's `/usr/libexec/path_helper`.

## <a name="what-does-that-do-">WHAT DOES THAT DO?</a>

It helps set the PATH and MANPATH environment variables.

## <a name="how-does-the-apple-one-work-">HOW DOES THE APPLE ONE WORK?</a>

Segments of the path are defined in text files under `/etc/paths.d` and in `/etc/path`. For example, on my machine:

    $ tree /etc/paths.d
    /etc/paths.d
    ├── 10-BitKeeper
    ├── 10-pkgsrc
    ├── 15-macports
    ├── 20-XCode
    ├── MacGPG2
    ├── dotnet
    ├── dotnet-cli-tools
    ├── go
    ├── mono-commands
    └── workbooks

    $ cat /etc/paths /etc/paths.d/*
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/sbin
    /bin
    /sbin
    /Applications/GPAC.app/Contents/MacOS/
    /Applications/BitKeeper.app/Contents/Resources/bitkeeper
    /opt/pkg/sbin
    /opt/pkg/bin
    /opt/local/bin
    /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
    /usr/local/MacGPG2/bin
    /usr/local/share/dotnet
    ~/.dotnet/tools
    /usr/local/go/bin
    /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands
    /Applications/Xamarin Workbooks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/path-bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/sbin
    /bin
    /sbin
    /Applications/GPAC.app/Contents/MacOS/

## <a name="why-replace-it-">WHY REPLACE IT?</a>

Because Apple's one loads the system libraries to the front, take a look:

    $ /usr/libexec/path_helper
    PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/Applications/GPAC.app/Contents/MacOS/:/usr/local/go/bin:/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin:<snip!>
  
…the rest of the items are added *after*, which means anything you add to `/etc/paths.d/` will end up after the system libraries.
  
Want your up-to-date OpenSSL installed via Macports to be first in the PATH? 
Apple says *"too bad!"*
  
Want your much newer version of LLVM installed via pkgin to be hit first?
Apple says *"too bad!"*

Well, there are alternatives.

## <a name="more-drawbacks">MORE DRAWBACKS</a>

Where the Apple `path_helper` falls down is:

- It puts things in `/etc`, meaning you need elevated permissions to add/remove path segments.
- Being in /etc also makes them system wide.
- It's only for `PATH` and `MANPATH` but development and administration often need headers and libraries accessible in the same way too.
- The string it returns is designed to be `eval`'d. I know that `eval` isn't *always* evil but why not just return the `PATH` string and allow it to be set to a variable? Maybe there's more to be added.

## <a name="alternatively---">ALTERNATIVELY...</a>

This library fixes those problems and extends the concept to include other paths:
  
    C_INCLUDE_PATH  
    DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH  
    DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH  
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH

and of course, `PATH` and `MANPATH`.

## <a name="do-i-need-to-be-on-apple-to-use-it-">DO I NEED TO BE ON APPLE TO USE IT?</a>

No, it should work on any unix-like system. It has one dependency, and that is Ruby. The script should work with any system running Ruby 2.3.7 or above, as that is the version that ships with a Mac.

## <a name="how-does-path-helper-know-what-to-put-in-the-path-">HOW DOES PATH_HELPER KNOW WHAT TO PUT IN THE PATH?</a>

Apple has put paths in `/etc/paths` and further files are there for the user or apps to add under `/etc/paths.d/`. If you want to order them then prefixing a number works well, e.g.

    $ tree /etc/paths.d
    /etc/paths.d
    ├── 10-pkgsrc
    └── MacGPG2
    └── ImageMagick

The format of the file is simply a path per line, e.g.

    $ cat /etc/paths.d/10-pkgsrc
    /opt/pkg/bin
    /opt/pkg/sbin

    $ cat /etc/paths            
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/sbin
    /bin
    /sbin

The order *within* the file matters as well as the order the files are read/concatenated.

### Note: ###

The `/etc/paths` file in Apple isn't set out fully or in the order I'd want so I changed mine, you may want to do the same.


## <a name="per-user-paths">PER USER PATHS</a>

This is the bit I like best.

There's not really any help made for paths that might be local to the user, like `~/.rubies` or something like that so I've added two places the Ruby script will check for further paths:

- `~/Library/Paths/paths.d` and
- `~/Library/Paths/paths`
- `~/.config/paths.d/` and
- `~/.config/paths`

You can use the `--setup` switch to have the path_helper set up the directory layout and files, you just have to fill them!

The Ruby script will also allow use of the tilde `~` character in a path by replacing it with the `HOME` env variable. For example, if I install Haskell and want to put it in my path I can do the following:

### <a name="pre-req">PRE-REQ</a>

    path_helper --setup --no-config --no-etc

This would set up the `~/Library/Paths` for you, which fits a Mac very well.

    path_helper --setup --no-lib --no-etc

You might choose this way if you're on a Mac or using Linux. It's up to you.

### <a name="way-1--use-the-paths--luke">WAY 1, USE THE PATHS, LUKE</a>

On my Mac, Haskell resides in `~/Library/Haskell`.

    $ echo '~/Library/Haskell/bin' > ~/Library/Paths/paths

    $ tree ~/Library/Paths 
    /Users/iainb/Library/Paths
    ├── paths
    └── paths.d

    $ cat ~/Library/Paths/paths                          
    ~/Library/Haskell/bin

That puts `/Users/iainb/Library/Haskell/bin` at the front of my path and will only apply to my account's `PATH`.

### <a name="way-2--paths-d-">WAY 2, PATHS.D/</a>

    $ touch ~/Library/Paths/paths.d/60-Haskell

    $ tree ~/Library/Paths 
    /Users/iainb/Library/Paths
    ├── paths
    └── paths.d
        └── 60-Haskell


## <a name="why-use-the-paths-d-sub-directory">WHY USE THE PATHS.D SUB DIRECTORY?</a>

If I show you my actual set up it'll become clearer:

    $ tree ~/Library/Paths 
    /Users/iainb/Library/Paths
    ├── paths
    └── paths.d
        ├── 05-pkgsrc
        ├── 08-homebrew
        ├── 10-keybase
        ├── 30-oh-my-zshell
        ├── 50-ngrok
        ├── 55-Crystal-opt
        ├── 60-Crystal
        ├── 61-Opam
        ├── 62-Haskell
        ├── 63-Erlang
        ├── 63-Go
        ├── 64-Pyenv
        ├── 65-Rust
        └── 66-Antigen

Once you start installing various things it make sense to keep their paths in their own file, it's easier to organise (and remove). It's also easy for apps to target this to easily add things to a path. Some apps already do this by adding to `/etc/paths.d` but that obviously needs elevated privileges and makes things system wide.

## <a name="ordering">ORDERING</a>

path_helper will read files in this order:

    ~/Library/Paths/paths.d
    ~/Library/Paths/paths
    ~/.config/paths.d
    ~/.config/paths
    /etc/paths.d
    /etc/paths

If you don't have any of those dirs/files, they are skipped. Files within the `.d` dirs are read in file system order.

## <a name="why-library-paths-paths-and-not-library-paths-">WHY LIBRARY/PATHS/PATHS AND NOT LIBRARY/PATHS?</a>

Because this is such a useful pattern that it can be extended for headers and includes, so Library/Paths/paths is for the PATH.

## <a name="man-and-dyld-and-c-include-and-pkg-config">MAN and DYLD and C_INCLUDE and PKG_CONFIG</a>

### <a name="manpath">MANPATH</a>

Apple has already dictated that `/etc/manpaths` and `/etc/manpaths.d/` are the default paths for setting `MANPATH`, so the same pattern has been followed for that as with `PATH`, so just add `~/Library/Paths/manpaths` or `~/.config/manpaths` along with the `manpaths.d` sub directory if you wish.

- `~/Library/Paths/manpaths.d/`
- `~/.config/manpaths`
- `~/Library/Paths/manpaths.d/`
- `~/.config/manpaths`
- `/etc/manpaths.d/`
- `/etc/manpaths`

I can tell you it's a very pleasant experience typing `man blah` for the thing I just installed and getting the correct man page up.


### <a name="dyld-fallback-library-path-and-dyld-fallback-framework-path">DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH</a>

Same goes for DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH (if using the Ruby script):

- `~/Library/Paths/dyld_library_paths.d/`
- `~/Library/Paths/dyld_library_paths`
- `~/.config/dyld_library_paths.d/`
- `~/.config/dyld_library_paths`
- `/etc/dyld_library_paths.d/`
- `/etc/dyld_library_paths`

and:

- `~/Library/Paths/dyld_framework_paths.d/`
- `~/Library/Paths/dyld_framework_paths`
- `~/.config/dyld_framework_paths.d/` 
- `~/.config/dyld_framework_paths` 
- `/etc/dyld_framework_paths.d/`
- `/etc/dyld_framework_paths`


### <a name="c-include-path">C_INCLUDE_PATH</a>

Same again for `C_INCLUDE_PATH`:

- `~/Library/Paths/include_paths.d/`
- `~/Library/Paths/include_paths`
- `~/.config/include_paths.d/`
- `~/.config/include_paths`
- `/etc/include_paths.d/`
- `/etc/include_paths`

### <a name="pkg-config-path">PKG_CONFIG_PATH</a>

Did you know that there's a `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`? There is, check the man page, it's very helpful.

- `~/Library/Paths/pkg_config_paths.d/`
- `~/Library/Paths/pkg_config_paths`
- `~/.config/pkg_config_paths.d/`
- `~/.config/pkg_config_paths`
- `/etc/pkg_config_paths.d/`
- `/etc/pkg_config_paths`


## <a name="how-do-i-get-this-wonderful-joyful-event-maker-into-my-life-">HOW DO I GET THIS WONDERFUL JOYFUL EVENT MAKER INTO MY LIFE?</a>

### A.K.A. install instructions

I was going to make this into a Ruby gem but that is such a faff. Here's the gist of it:

- Download it (use `git clone` or a download link, you can even just copy and past the [script](exe/path_helper))
- Make sure it has the correct permissions (`chmod +x`)
- Have a look at the help by running it with `-h`.
- Run the `--setup` (take note of the `--lib` and `--config` and their `--no-` counterparts)
- Copy and paste the bit setup tells you to, and put it in your `~/.zshenv` or `~/.bashenv`
- Find your life is so much better now it's easy to manage your paths

*It doesn't need to be in* `/usr/local/bin`, or any special place, just `chmod +x` it and call it by the full path and it'll plop out a string for you.

## <a name="for-example-">FOR EXAMPLE:</a>

I put my path_helper in `/usr/local/libexec` because I'm the only person using this machine and I want my other accounts to be able to access its goodness but you can put it anywhere you like.

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/libexec
    cd /usr/local/libexec

`~/Projects/path_helper` is where I keep the project so I link it, but you could just download it or `git clone` it there, or somewhere else and link it… it all works!

    ln ~/Projects/path_helper/exe/path_helper .
    chmod +x /usr/local/libexec/path_helper

Look at the help because you're not like everyone else, you read instructions ;-)

    /usr/local/libexec/path_helper --help

You need `sudo` to add the folders in `/etc`, see the `--help` if you don't want that.

    sudo /usr/local/libexec/path_helper --setup

See what's already there

    /usr/local/libexec/path_helper --debug


Apple's path_helper is in `/usr/libexec`, this install won't touch it, you can always use it or return to it if you wish.

And checking its output:

    $ /usr/local/libexec/path_helper -p
    /opt/pkg/sbin:/opt/pkg/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/opt/ImageMagick/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/opt/puppetlabs/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin"
    
To put it into the PATH via the command line:

    $ PATH=$(/usr/local/libexec/path_helper -p)
    $ export PATH

but you'll probably use the helpful `--setup` instructions.

## NOTE!

Remember, the script **doesn't set the PATH**, it *returns* a path, **you have to set the path** with it e.g. `PATH=$(/usr/local/libexec/path_helper.rb -p "")`. Call `/usr/local/libexec/path_helper -h` to see all the options.

Everything you need to know! Very useful for working out when other things are manipulating the path too.

## <a name="development">DEVELOPMENT</a>

I'm happy to hear from you, email me or open an issue. Pull requests are fine too, try to bring me a spec or an example if you want a feature or find a bug.

### TO GET SET UP FOR DEVELOPMENT

Run:

    docker build --squash -t path_helper .

and I tend to get rid of the intermediate layers:

    docker images --no-trunc -aqf "dangling=true" | xargs docker rmi

### TO RUN THE SPECS

    docker run --rm path_helper

### SHELL IN AND HAVE A PLAY:

    docker run --rm -ti --entrypoint="" path_helper sh

Run some tests yourself:

    ./spec/shell_spec.sh

Set up some paths using the test fixtures:

    ./exe/path_helper --setup --no-lib
    cp -R spec/fixtures/moredirs/* ~/.config/paths

Have a look at the output:
